                <h3>Day 1:</h3>
                <p>
                    day 1: Okay so the first thing I learned is that you can
                    make a h1 element to make a header and so, I made one right there.
                    Now I'm wondering how lists work because I saw that you can use <abbr title="unordered lists">ul</abbr>
                    and also li
                    <br><br>
                    , I came back on day 4 here and basically so what I learned is that you can use <strong>Like this to bold stuff.</strong><br>
                    COOL RIGHT?
                </p>

                <ul class="li-georgian">
                <li><a href="https://seulgi.zip/">My wife's website</a></li>

                <li>
                    A vegan latte

                    <li>soy latte</li>
                    <li>oat latte</li>
                    </ul>
                    Pretty yummy
                </li>
                </ul>
                <p>My next goal I guess is to find a way in order to show different pages depending on the week maybe?</p>
            </section>

            <!-- day 2 -->
            <section id="day2">
                <h3>Day 2:</h3>
                <p>
                    Alright so, today I learned that margin is outside of the container and padding is to shrink within the border of the element.
                    Pretty cool. hmm, I wonder how I can enter on this?? <br>
                    Ohhh, like this <br>
                    Cooool.</p>
                <p>
                    Now i'm wondering how if I could make a bar on the left side like most webpages have
                    that will have a scroller so that I can link to the days in this sheet <br>
                    hmmmmm. </p>
                <p>yosh I made a side bar, but now I'm thinking that maybe I should add some function to it, also, the emoji doesn't work with the ::before statement in the list item, hmmmmmmm.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="day3">
                <h3>Day 3:</h3>
                <p>Alright sooo, I finally finished the side bar and now there's buttons to just click to here I guess.
                    <br> I wonder what else I'm going to try.</p>
                    <p>Maybbeeee an image thing? Idk</p>
                    <a href="https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/ALGORITHM"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vocaloid/images/e/ef/ALGORITHM.png/revision/latest?cb=20140810055334" alt="an image of utsu-p's album"></a>
                    <p>aaaaand finally done, yayyyyy, <br>
                    well okay so, now I made it so that you can click on the image and you'll be brought to the wikipage, I also made a block display when toggled by the button at the left top, that it'll make the display darker under the bar. <br>
                    I've already learned soooo much, but only like 0.0001% of whats out there.
                    btw eat your beans.</p>

                    <p>I wonder what more I could do before I start making the kanji app.
                        hmmmmm.
                    </p>
                    <p>Alriggghhht, so, now I made the sidebar close too whenever the day buttons are pressed. <br>
                    I did it by creating an extra function that will be enabling the showing of the bar whenever the function is called. <br>
                    rn it happens by clicking the button and the day thingies.</p>

                    <p>I'm thinking about making a function tomorrow where you can add a to do list maybe.</p>
